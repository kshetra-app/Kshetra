**Last Updated:** 2026-09-08
**Standard:** AI Agent Master Execution Job Book (Section 0.9, 0.10, Part 12)

### DEC-001: Adoption of Master Blueprint and Sequential Job Book as Sole Source of Truth
- **Date:** 2026-09-08
- **Context:** Project requires unified direction transitioning from Kshetra exploratory phase to finished PANIN production platform.
- **Decision:** Officially adopt `Kshetra - PANIN — Master Product, Technology, Data, Growth and 100% Execution Blueprint.md` as product constitution and `PANIN - Kshetra — AI Agent Master Execution Document and Sequential Job Book.md` as operational execution manual.
- **Rationale:** Prevents build sprawl, eliminates "90% complete forever" trap, and anchors all platform layers to the Political Geography Graph moat.
- **Consequences:** All work must proceed through sequential jobs (W000–W100) with evidence-backed acceptance criteria.

### DEC-002: Modular Monolith API Architecture (Railway Fastify + Supabase Persistence)
- **Date:** 2026-09-08
- **Context:** Mobile app currently exhibits dual-path architecture (direct Supabase JS vs Fastify API).
- **Decision:** Fastify on Railway serves as the canonical application/API layer (business logic, validation, rate limiting, external orchestration). Supabase serves as canonical persistence (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Auth, Storage, RLS).
- **Rationale:** Direct client writes to database bypass server-side auditing, rate limiting, and business validation. Modular monolith in Fastify keeps deployment simple and fast without microservice overhead.
- **Consequences:** All sensitive client writes must transition to `/api/v1/...` Fastify endpoints via a phased strangler pattern.

### DEC-003: Separation of Creator Broadcasting from Consumer Mobile Client
- **Date:** 2026-09-08
- **Context:** `react-native-webrtc` is bundled in `apps/mobile`, threatening the ≤ 25–30 MB consumer binary target.
- **Decision:** Decouple native broadcaster infrastructure from the consumer mobile app. Heavy stream ingestion/broadcasting tools belong on web (`apps/web-receiver` / Studio) or dedicated companion builds. Consumer app consumes HLS/video feeds.
- **Rationale:** Indian mobile users on budget Android devices cannot tolerate 50MB+ download packages for creator features 99% of them will never use.

### DEC-004: Brand Transition Governance (Internal Stability until Legal Brand Lock)
- **Date:** 2026-09-08
- **Context:** Blueprint specifies brand evolution towards "PANIN" while repository uses `Kshetra`.
- **Decision:** Retain existing internal technical identifiers (`kshetra-api`, `in.kshetra.app`, internal DB namespaces) until legal trademark and app-store clearances are complete. Introduce PANIN as a user-facing brand presentation without breaking git/database lineage.
- **Rationale:** Avoids destructive churn and breaking database migrations during active stabilization.

### DEC-005: Binding 100% i18n Localization Mandate (All 13 Languages)
- **Date:** 2026-09-08
- **Context:** User mandate requires every single screen, component, dialog, error state, and data label to be 100% i18n compliant across all 13 supported languages.
- **Decision:** All 13 languages (`en`, `te`, `hi`, `ta`, `kn`, `ml`, `mr`, `bn`, `gu`, `or`, `pa`, `as`, `ne`) must achieve 100% string parity with zero missing keys. Hardcoded user-facing strings are strictly prohibited.
- **Rationale:** PANIN is a Pan-Indian platform. Linguistic completeness is a core trust and retention pillar, not an afterthought. Non-English users must never encounter raw English fallback strings or layout clipping.
- **Consequences:** All future feature implementations and bug fixes must include translation keys for all 13 locales before marking a job `ACCEPTED`. Automated AST lint checks will reject unlocalized JSX text.
